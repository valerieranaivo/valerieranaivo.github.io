## About me

Turning raw data into insights and visualisations that help to uncover new learning is my passion, and what drives me forward! 
I hold a Bachelor's-level diploma in Data analytics from OpenClassrooms / the National Economics and Statistics School of France and I have several years experience supporting non-profit organisations in their decision processes. 
This portfolio showcases a few projects I have worked on.
